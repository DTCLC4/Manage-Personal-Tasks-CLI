Feature

Task Creation: Allow users to create new tasks with a title, description, due date, priority level, and any other relevant metadata.

Task Retrieval: Enable users to retrieve their existing tasks, either all at once or filtered by parameters like status (e.g., completed, pending), due date, or priority.

Task Update: Provide endpoints for users to update task details such as title, description, due date, priority, and status (e.g., marking a task as completed).

Task Deletion: Allow users to delete tasks they no longer need or want to track.

Task Filtering and Sorting: Implement functionality to filter and sort tasks based on different criteria such as due date, priority, status, etc.

Task Reminders: Incorporate the ability for users to set reminders for their tasks, either through push notifications, emails, or SMS.

User Authentication and Authorization: Ensure that only authenticated users can access and manipulate their tasks, and implement proper authorization to restrict access to certain actions (e.g., only allowing task deletion by the task owner).

Integration: Consider integrating with other tools or platforms such as calendars, email clients, or project management software to enhance usability and interoperability.

Data Export: Allow users to export their task data in common formats like CSV or JSON for backup or analysis purposes.

API Documentation: Provide comprehensive documentation for developers who want to integrate with your API, including endpoints, request/response formats, authentication methods, error handling, etc.
